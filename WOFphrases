hell has no fury like a woman scorned
open a can of worms
barking up the wrong tree
jack of all trades, master of none
a Dime a Dozen
a watched pot never boils
it's all Greek to me
break a leg
high as a kite
a piece of cake
fall on your sword
kill two birds with one stone
a dog is a mans best friend
i feel under the weather
you canâ€™t judge a book by its cover
i dont know
lyle boland bleckel
add insult to injury
computers suck
a bird in the hand
can you not
clown club
calculus is dumb
the best of both worlds
calm before the storm
let the cat out of the bag
back to Square One
speak of the devil
see eye to eye
beating around the bush
once in a blue moon
stuck between a rock and a hard place
close but no cigar
a chip on your shoulder
hit the nail on the head
get your goat
loose lips sink ships
cry over spilled milk
kangaroo court
when pigs fly
barrel of laughs
curiosity killed the cat
let sleeping dogs lie
deus ex machina
to cost an arm and a leg
